[Date Night](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/date_night) is an assignment using Binary Search Tree for storing a list of movies for a streaming service. Each time movies are added to the service, an algorithm determines a score of how likely a given user is to enjoy that movie.

- Scores are integers between 0 and 100
- No two movies will get the same score
